spew - stupid proc extraction worker

This is a dumb replacement for sysstat/iostat/vmstat/etc.  It takes
snapshots of files in /proc and saves them in an easy to
parse-with-python format.  The intent is to make resource utilization
tracking more agile, more amenable to post-processing, and to
eventually incorporate container group-based resource usage tracking.

Basically, we dump timestamped file contents encapsulated as (possibly
compressed) json dicts.  File contents can be parsed as part of
post-processing.  Timestamp is floating-point seconds since the
epoch.

  <TIMESTAMP> <json string>
